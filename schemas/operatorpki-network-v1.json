  "description": "OperatorPKI is a simple certificate authority. It is not intended for external use - rather, it is internal to the network operator. The CNO creates a CA and a certificate signed by that CA. The certificate has both ClientAuth and ServerAuth extended usages enabled. \n  More specifically, given an OperatorPKI with <name>, the CNO will manage: - A Secret called <name>-ca with two data keys:   - tls.key - the private key   - tls.crt - the CA certificate - A ConfigMap called <name>-ca with a single data key:   - cabundle.crt - the CA certificate(s) - A Secret called <name>-cert with two data keys:   - tls.key - the private key   - tls.crt - the certificate, signed by the CA \n The CA certificate will have a validity of 10 years, rotated after 9. The target certificate will have a validity of 6 months, rotated after 3 \n The CA certificate will have a CommonName of \"<namespace>_<name>-ca@<timestamp>\", where <timestamp> is the last rotation time.",
